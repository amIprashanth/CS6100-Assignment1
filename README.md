Working C++ code with longest path, independent set and vertex cover functions in case of trees.

The input tree is given from stdin. For example, a simple path with 7 vertices can be given as follows:

7

1 2
2 3
3 4
5 4
6 5
6 7

Upon giving the input, the longest path, maximum ind. set and vertex cover are printed to stdout. 
I haven't written the function for minimum dominating set in the C++ code, but the psuedo code written in the PDF submission works.
